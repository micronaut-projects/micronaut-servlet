This section documents breaking changes between Micronaut Servlet versions:

== Micronaut Servlet 5.0.0

=== Deprecations

- The Singleton constructor `io.micronaut.servlet.engine.DefaultServletHttpHandler(ApplicationContext) deprecated previously has been removed.
`DefaultServletHttpHandler(ApplicationContext, ConversionService)` is used instead.

- The abstract class constructor `io.micronaut.servlet.http.ServletHttpHandler(ApplicationContext)` deprecated previously has been removed.
`ServletHttpHandler(ApplicationContext, ConversionService)` is used instead.

== Micronaut Servlet 3.3.4

=== Binding network interface

Previously, the default servlet engine will bind to all network interfaces.
This is a security risk.
Now, the default servlet engine will bind to `localhost` only.
To restore the original functionality, you need to configure `micronaut.server.host`, or set the `HOST` environment variable.
