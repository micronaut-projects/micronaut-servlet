== 3.3.4

=== Binding network interface

Previously, the default servlet engine will bind to all network interfaces.
This is a security risk.
Now, the default servlet engine will bind to `localhost` only.
To restore the original functionality, you need to configure `micronaut.server.host`, or set the `HOST` environment variable.
