In general you can follow the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#httpServer[documentation for the HTTP server] when building applications. All non-Netty specific features of the default HTTP server  should work the same for Servlet containers (https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-servlet/issues[Report an issue] if you find a difference).

There are a couple of additional extensions within Micronaut Servlet that make it easier to work with the Servlet API which are detailed in the following sections.

=== Injecting the Servlet Request and Response

You can receive the `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` objects directly as parameters:

.Using the Request and Response
[source,java]
----
include::http-server-jetty/src/test/java/io/micronaut/servlet/jetty/docs/DocsController.java[tags=reqrep, indent=0]
----

<1> The request object
<2> The response object

=== Simplified I/O code with Readable and Writable

Writing to the response and reading from the request can be simplified with Micronaut's `Readable` and `Writable` interfaces:

.Using Readable and Writable
[source,java]
----
include::http-server-jetty/src/test/java/io/micronaut/servlet/jetty/docs/DocsController.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::http-server-jetty/src/test/java/io/micronaut/servlet/jetty/docs/DocsController.java[tags=writable, indent=0]
----

=== Multipart support with `@Part`

Multipart support is improved with the ability to inject parts using the annotation `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Part`. For example:


.Using `@Part`
[source,java]
----
include::http-server-jetty/src/test/java/io/micronaut/servlet/jetty/docs/DocsController.java[tags=multipart, indent=0]
----

<1> You can receive attributes with just parameter names that match the attribute name
<2> Parts that have a content type of `application/json` can be bound to POJOs
<3> You can read parts as text
<4> You can read parts as `byte[]`
<5> You can receive the raw `jakarta.servlet.http.Part`
<6> You can receive Micronaut's `CompletedPart` interface which works with Netty too
