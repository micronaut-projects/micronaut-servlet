To deploy as a WAR file you need to make some adjustments to your dependencies.

Firsts make the server you are using a `developmentOnly` dependency (or `provided` in Maven):

dependency:io.micronaut.servlet:micronaut-http-server-jetty[version="{version}", scope="provided"]

Then make sure you include `micronaut-servlet-engine` dependency in your build configuration:

dependency:io.micronaut.servlet:micronaut-servlet-engine[version="{version}"]

Then alter your build configuration to build a WAR file. In Gradle this can be done by applying the WAR plugin:

.Applying the Gradle WAR plugin
----
plugins {
    id "war"
    id "application"
}
----

You can then build the WAR file and deploy it to the Servlet container as per the instructions provided by the container.

TIP: Micronaut will load using api:servlet.engine.initializer.MicronautServletInitializer[] which registers the api:servlet.engine.DefaultMicronautServlet[] instance.
