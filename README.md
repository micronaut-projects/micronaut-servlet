Releases are published to JCenter and Maven Central via [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-servlet/actions).

A release is performed with the following steps:

* [Publish the draft release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-servlet/releases). There should be already a draft release created, edit and publish it. The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
* [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-servlet/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
* Celebrate!
